# Quotes-To-Scrape
Webscraping assignment using quotestoscrape.com

For my college webscraping class, one of our assignments was to build a webscraping tool to use on quotestoscrape.com.

In this project we used BeautifulSoup, and Pandas.  Some useful coding skills I gained involved:
  -for loops
  -handling pagination
  -webscraping
  -using pandas to build a dataframe
  
  **Question1**
  This was a simple scrape that captured the author, quote, and related tags.
  
  **Question2**
  In this scrape we extended further by automating the "click through" to the "About the Author" page,
  gathering data on their date of birth and place of birth.
  
  **Question3**
  In this scrape we handled pagination to scroll through the different pages on the website and compile data on the author, quote, and related tags
  throughout the different pages.
